# Fluid typography and modular scales

This is a little project I made for a Wundetalk on December 17th 2019. Wundertalks are internal knowledge-sharing sessions at my super cool workplace, [Wunder](https://github.com/wunderio)!

This demo reflects knowledge I have gathered from many sources (mostly from [this article titled "Responsive And Fluid Typography With vh And vw Units"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/), as well as from personal experience.
